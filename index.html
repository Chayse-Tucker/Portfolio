            <h1>Bio</h1>
            <p>Hi again! I am Chayse Tucker, son to wonderful parents( Angie and Don). I’m in the eleventh grade at CodeRVA Regional High School. I’m on the advanced route at my school, so once I graduate high school, I’ll have an Associates' degree in Computer Science from J Sargent Reynolds Community College. Recently, I got onto the Dean's List for the Reynold's, which was amazing!</p>
            <p>My interests, if you haven't noticed so far, are Boy Scouts, lifeguarding/ swimming, and theatre. At my school, I'm involved in the Student Council Association(SCA), Yearbook Committee, National Honors Society, Prom Committee, and Student Ambassadors.</p>
            <p>I had the pleasure of interning with Maxx Potential. During this internship, and have gotten to learn so much about the different positions of a tech company. I never thought that policymaking would be so fun! Writing them made me think outside of the box because you need to be prepared to protect a company from all forms of attacks. I also built strong skills in HTML and CSS, team collaboration, communicating, and problem-solving.                </p>

            <h1>Future Plans</h1>
            <p>After highschool, I plan on going to college to study theatre, computer science, or software engineering. I will most likely double major in two of the options. I choose these majors because I have a passion for all of them! They all excite me and intellectually stimulate my brain. I only have one goal in life, which is to be successful in whatever I do! I plan on achieving that goal through hard work, faith, and always taking the advice of others.                </p>
